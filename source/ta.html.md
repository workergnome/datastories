### About Me

I am a second year Public Policy student in the Data Analytics track. I'm interested in how data tools and visualiztions can be used to inform public policy and communicate important narratives better.
You can see some of my projects for school and and for fun [here](http://www.laurenrenaud.com/portfolio/). I also like maps, bicycles, and natural bodies of water.

If you like this class and want to learn more or use it more, I encourage you to check out Students for Urban Data Systems, [SUDS](http://suds-cmu.org/).
We're a group that enjoys using data to tell stories for social good. Plus, great workshops, fun work nights, cool people.
