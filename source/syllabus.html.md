## Introduction

We live in a world awash with data.  Cheap storage, ubiquitous sensors, and an ever-more-connected world provide an enormous amount of information every day. As humanity moves from an environment of data scarcity to one of data overload, it is important to understand what can (and what should) be done with the ever-increasing amounts of information that society produces.  Digital technology gives us the capability to manipulate and store that information, but communication of ideas is still a task for humans.   How can we use those qualities that make us human to better understand our data-driven world?

Data visualization is the art of understanding how humans understand our visual environment, and of applying that knowledge to the visual representation of information.  Through the technique of data visualization we can express the stories that underlie the data, and identify specific elements that allow us to explain, persuade, and inform ourselves and others.


#### Course Objectives

There are two major practices of data visualization.  One is **exploratory** data visualization, where visualization is used to understand new information.  The other is **explanatory** data visualization, where the visualization is used to communicate a specific understanding of data.  While the lines between these two practices are not well-defined, this course will focus primarily on **explanatory** data visualization.

This course will also focus on *small data*, by which I mean datasets that fit within a spreadsheet or within a computer's memory.  It will focus on visualization, not data manipulation.  And it will focus on techniques rather than on technologies.  While software is an essential part of data visualization, the goal of this course is to focus on communicating information to people, and specifc software is merely one means to an end.

At the end of this course, you will:

* Be able to analyze a data environment, evaluate potential stories, identify a specific question, and write a creative brief for data visualization.
* Be able to read and evaluate a creative brief for data visualization, and be able to create a visualization that meets that brief.
* Be able to choose appropriate software and other technology for a data visualization given your personal abilities and the goals of the project.
* Have a demonstrable understanding of visualization techniques, types of charts and graph techniques, color theory, human visual perception, and basic story forms.
* Discuss the history, ethical implications, and potential future for data visualization.
* Be able to communicate specific messages with data and to use data persuasively.
* Have a working ability to obtain, analyse, manipulate, transform, and distribute data.

At the end of this course, you will have a complete case study, from brief to visualization, demonstrating your solution to a data visualization problem in a given domain.



#### Prerequisites

This course is designed for graduate-level students with an interest in data visualization and communication.  It does not assume or require any programming abilities beyond the ability to write basic spreadsheet formulas.  It does not require sophisticated statistical abilities or math skills. It *does* require competence with spreadsheets and the ability to write clearly. 

The course will also require a strong aptitude for self-guided learning of software tools.  While we will demonstrate software like Tableau and Carto, the course will not focus on teaching you how to use specific software tools; instead, it will help you understand what tools you might want to use and direct you towards resources to learn those tools.  I am always willing to help answer specific questions, but the focus of this course will be on the visualizations themselves, not on the tools we use to help make those visualizations.



## Course Materials

As the required textbook, we will use [*Data Visualisation, A Handbook for Data Driven Design*](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Visualisation-Handbook-Driven-Design/dp/1473912148/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=) by Andy Kirk (ISBN 978-1-4739-1214-4). This will serve as a primary reference material for much of what we cover in class.  It's available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Visualisation-Handbook-Driven-Design/dp/1473912148/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=), which is probably the most convenient way to get it.

*(Note that there is a hardcover version of this book, but it's VERY expensive and intended for libraries.  There's also a e-book version of it, which is slightly cheaper.  Doesn't matter to me which one you get, but you will need to have a copy of it.)*

In addition to this book, we will also heavily use online resources and examples, which will be available as links on the [course website](http://datastories.davidnewbury.com).    

All software required for use in this course will be freely available, or freely available for non-commercial use.  Other software can be used, of course, but will not be required.

## Course Activities

Project Type       |  Number of Graded Parts     | Total Grade % |
-------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|
In-Class Quizzes   | 10 of 11 quizzes  (3% each) | 30%           |
Technology Reviews | 4 of 6 workshops (5% each)  | 20%           | 
Final Project      | 5 components  (10% each)    | 50%           | 


Data visualization is fundamentally a subjective experience, and as such this will not be an exam-heavy course.  Instead, much of the work will focus on projects, with additional grading of written critiques of existing visualizations.  The course will focus on understanding the techniques of data visualization through developing creative visualizations using new tools to solve defined projects, and through deep analysis of existing visualizations.

There will be three categories of assignments for this course:


#### In-Class Visualization Quizzes:  **30%**

At the beginning of every class, we will have a short in-class quiz where we answer questions about a visualization.  These questions will be based on criteria discussed in the readings for that class. These quizzes will **not** be graded.  Towards the end of each class period, there will be a second quiz, using the same questions, but about a second visualization.  These will be completed in-class as group work, where each group will consist of three students.  The group quiz **will** be graded.

There will be 11 of these quizzes, and you can drop your lowest score.  Each of these quizzes will be worth 3% of your final grade, and they can only be done in class.  There will be not be an opportunity to make these up after class, so if you must miss class for illness or family emergency, please let me know **before the class** to make arrangements.    


#### Technology Explorations:  **20%**  

Each Wednesday thoughout the course we will be exploring a software tool for creating data visualizations.  There will be an in-class demonstration and mini-workshop where you will be introduced to the week's tool, and there will also be a take-home assignment for each workshop that builds upon the work done in class.  There will be six of these assignments, and you can drop your lowest two scores.

### Workshop Schedule 

Week   | Date     | Tool           |  Link
-------|----------|----------------|---------------------------------------
Week 1 | March 22 | Google Sheets  | <https://www.google.com/sheets/>
Week 2 | March 29 | Highcharts.js  | <http://www.highcharts.com>
Week 3 | April 5  | D3.js          | <https://d3js.org>
Week 4 | April 12 | Tableau Public | <https://public.tableau.com/s/>
Week 5 | April 19 | P5.js          | <https://d3js.org>
Week 6 | April 26 | Carto          | <https://carto.com>

These take-home explorations are designed to provide you a structure for exploring the tool.  I don't expect that you will master the tool in a single workshop, so these will be evaluated on effort and exploration, not on proficiency.  They will involve customizing the work done in class, and as such are designed to be done individually. Projects that are substantially the same with other student's work will be given a 0.  
  
The completed explorations are due the Monday following the workshop.  


#### Final Project:  **50%**

The second half of the course will be be focused on working through the process of creating a single data communication project.  We will take this project from initial analysis, through creation of a brief, identification of techniques, creating visualizations, and final a presentation. These visualization projects will be done as individual projects, but I highly recommend working in groups around the same underlying dataset, though on different briefs.  This will allow teamwork and collaboration, while still allowing for individual variance.

The available datasets are:

* [the AidData Research Sets](http://aiddata.org/aiddata-research-datasets), which contains data on international development aid.
* [Allegheny County Housing Data](https://data.wprdc.org/organization/f6dcf8fb-2051-4226-8c74-de9fbc699684?groups=housing-properties), which is a set of data files describing real estate transactions in our county.
* [Carnegie Museum of Art Collection Information](https://github.com/cmoa/collection), which is the metadata for CMOA's art collection.
* A TBD Health Data Set.


There will be five parts to the communication project:

* A **Brief** (due April 16), which will describe the goals and provide an overview of the story that you'd like to tell with your final visualization. 
* A **Sketch** (due April 23), which will provide a rough idea of what and how you will visualize your work. 
* A **Design** (due April 30), which will provide a visual language for your final design
* A **Presentation** (In class, the week of May 1), where you will discuss the decisions you made and present your visualization to the class
* A **Final Visualization** (Due May 7).

Each of these components will be worth 10% of your grade.  Additional information about the details of these assignments will be provided later in the course.

Late work will not be accepted.  

## Class Policies

#### Laptops and Phones

Laptops will be permitted in class, and will be required for use on Wednesdays.  Please be respectful of the class and your classmates with your use of laptops by avoiding distracting content.  If you feel the need to use you laptop for non-course purposes, please sit in the back two rows of the class. Phones should be on silent, and obviously you shouldn't talk on the phone during class.  Laptops and phones can not be used during quizzes.

If in-classroom technology becomes disruptive to the class, this policy will be revisited.

#### Attendance

There is a graded in-class quiz as part of every class, so it is in your best interest to attend.  Because you can drop one quiz, you *can* miss one class without penalty, but I suggest reserving this for an actual emergency. If you must miss class for illness, family emergency, or other valid reason, please let me know **before the class** to make arrangements.    

#### Grading Scale

We'll use the standard Heinz grading scale for this class.
    
Letter| Score        |Letter| Score       |Letter| Score       
------|--------------|------|-------------|------|-------------
A+    | 99.0-100%    |  B+  | 88.0-90.9%  | C+   |   78.0-80.9%
A     | 94.0-98.9%   |  B   | 84.0-87.9%  | C    |   74.0-77.9%
A-    | 91.0-93.9%   |  B-  | 81.0-83.9%  | C-   |   71.0-73.9% 


#### Recording

Most classes will have slides, and those slides will be made available after every class.  If you feel the need to record the class, discuss this with me prior to recording.  Any recordings made during class are for personal use only, and cannot be distributed in any fashion or format.

#### Food

Please, don't eat in the class—it's distracting.  Beverages are fine—I'll be drinking coffee, so it's only fair that you can, too.

#### Contacting Me

Due to the sleeping habits of small children and professional obligations, I strongly prefer that you email me instead of calling or texting.  I will make every effort to respond to emails as soon as I can.

#### Assistance for Disability

If you wish to request an accommodation due to a documented disability, please inform your instructor and contact Disability Resources at access@andrew.cmu.edu or 412-268-2013 as soon as possible.

#### Collaboration, Cheating and Plagiarism

Homework must be individual work unless otherwise stated. You are encouraged consult each other on clarification, technical and conceptual issues, and on interpreting the data but you must do individual problem solving and derive your own solutions, including your own computer and design work. If you have any question concerning whether an act is appropriate please consult me or the appropriate university official before acting. The minimum penalty for cheating on an assignment is zero credit for the work submitted, and the maximum penalty is being failed for the course. 

You are responsible for being familiar with the university standard for academic honesty and plagiarism. Please see the CMU Student Handbook for information. In order to deter and detect plagiarism, online tools and other resources are used in this class.
