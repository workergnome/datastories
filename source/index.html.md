## Course Description

Data visualization is the art of understanding how humans understand our visual environment and of applying that knowledge to the visual representation of information.  Through the technique of data visualization we can express the stories that underlie the data, and identify specific elements that allow us to explain, persuade, and inform ourselves and others. This course will teach explanatory data visualization, where a visualization is used to communicate a specific understanding of data.  It will also focus on small data: datasets that fit within a spreadsheet or within a computer's memory.  It will focus on visualization, not data manipulation.  It will also focus technique and theory rather than specific technologies.  The first half of the course will focus on understanding the techniques and theory of data visualization.  The second half of the course will be be focused on working through the process of a single data communication project, from initial analysis, through creation of a brief, identification of techniques, creating visualizations, and final presentation.
