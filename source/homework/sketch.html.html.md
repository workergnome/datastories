    Assignment: **Draw three sketches for your final visualization.**  
    Due: **Monday, April 24th, 1:30pm Eastern**
---

You will take your chosen dataset and, guided by your brief, sketch three possible data visualizations that might answer possible questions posed by your brief.   These are not intended to be final data visualizations—they're rough sketches to discover which forms of data visualization make sense, to determine the layout and structure of your visualization, and to identify what text is needed, and roughly where it should go.

The goal of this is to discover what form is most appropriate for your visualization and to discover what voice and is most appropriate for the structure.  It's also to determine basic layout.

The final form should be three one-page sketches.  My suggestion is to do these by hand and scan or photograph them—if you're more comfortable using a tool like Excel or Tableau to do your sketching, it's equally valid to use screenshots or to print and scan them.  You should be loose enough in your sketching that you're solving problems, not trying to make it look perfect.



These sketches should show:

* A sketch of the visualization or visualizations.
* Areas where text should go.  
* Titles, annotations, legends, captions, and axis where appropriate.

Please make the sketches distinct, and include a brief description of your thought process as part of this.


When complete, please email your **sketches** to <david.newbury@gmail.com> and <lauren.renaud@gmail.com> 

**This assignment is due Monday, April 24th, before class.**
