    Assignment: **Present your visualization to the class.**  
    Due: **Monday, May 1st & May 3rd, 1:30pm Eastern**
---

 You will present your visualization in front of the class, and discuss the decisions you made and show off your thinking and process.  This will be a short, 5 slide presentation, given in front of the class.  You will have 4  minutes to present, so make your slides easy to understand, and your presentation efficient.

The recommended order will be:

 * Slide 1:  Your dataset.
 * Slide 2:  Your brief.
 * Slide 3:  Your sketches.
 * Slide 4:  Your design.
 * Slide 5:  Your visualization.

You visualization does not have to be final at this point, but it wouldn't hurt to be very close.  This will be a chance to see what people think, and you will also have an opportunity to talk about it, which always makes it more real.

You will be evaluated on whether your slides convey the required information, if a viewer can understand both your visualization and your process through the explanation, and if you can stay within your time limit.

The slides should be made using Google Slides, and a link to your **publically shared** presentation should be emailed the **day before you present**.
