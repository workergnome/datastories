    Assignment: **Create a visualization using Highcharts about transportation.**  
    Due: **Monday, April 3rd, 1:30pm Eastern**
---

You are to create a data visualization using [Highcharts](http://highcharts.com) using data around transportation.  You can generate (or make up) this data from your own life, you can use an CSV file, or you can use publically available data.   

To present this data this data, we'll be using [Codepen](https://codepen.io/).  You can **fork** the [workshop Codepen](https://codepen.io/workergnome/pen/PpyOXe/) to start from. The [documentation on Highchart's site](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/) is excellent—I strongly recommend looking at it.

You chart should answer some question: please write your question into the HTML for the chart.

Spend some time and play with the options available for you in Highcharts. Customize you chart some way.  This is an opportunity to explore—your grade is not based on how impressive your chart is, so feel free to try things.  If you're comfortable with Javascript and HTML, try using external data or custom functions; if you're just learning about these things, try changing some values, adding some new configurations, or customizing the chart type and the colors.

### Helpful Hints:

* Javascript tends to be very picky about there being paired `{}`  and `[]`.  If you've got a problem, check if that's it.
* Commas.  You need a comma after every item—it's OK if there' a comma after the last one, so just put them everywhere.
* Quotation marks.  If you've got a word somewhere, it should be in quotes.  Numbers don't need quotation marks, nor do keys.
* Whitespace.  Javascript tends to ignore whitespace, so don't worry to much about it.  Indentation is good, though, because it helps you keep track of what you're doing.

### Example Syntax
```
 {
     anObject: { key: "Value", anotherKey: "anotherValue"},
     anArray: ["Array", "of", "Strings"],
     arrayOfNumbers: [1,2,3,4],
     anIndentedObject: {
        myNumber: 1,
        myArray: [1,2,3],
        nestedObject: {bird: "in a nest"},
     }
 }
```

When complete, please email a link to your **public** pen to <david.newbury@gmail.com> and <lauren.renaud@gmail.com> 

**This assignment is due Monday, April 3rd, before class.  Please don't modify your Codepen after submitting it.**
