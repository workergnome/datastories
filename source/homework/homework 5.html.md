    Assignment: **Create a Carto map using a found dataset.**  
    Due: **May 5th, 9am Eastern**
---

You are to create a new map using a found data set with Carto.

Most of the work of this project is about identifying a data set that contains geographical data and loading it into Carto.  Any data that is both public (no treasure maps or locations of missile silos, please), contains more that 20 points, contains at least one variable *beyond* lat/lng or zip, and can be loaded into Carto and shown on a map is valid.

Your map must have at least one widget and a meaningful title.  

You **cannot** use the McDonalds data set.

When complete, please email a link to your **published** carto link to <david.newbury@gmail.com> and <lauren.renaud@gmail.com> 

**This assignment is due May 5th, 9am Eastern.  Please don't modify your map after submitting it.**
