    Assignment: **Create an interactive animation using P5.js with colors and shapes.**  
    Due: **Monday, April 10th, 1:30pm Eastern**
---

You are to create an interactive animation using [P5.js](http://p5js.org) on CodePan.  

To present this data this data, we'll be using [Codepen](https://codepen.io/).  You can **fork** the [workshop Codepen](http://codepen.io/workergnome/pen/ZeZMdw/) to start from. The [documentation on P5.js's site](https://p5js.org/reference/) is excellent—I strongly recommend looking at it.

You animation should involve some form of interaction—using the mouse or the keyboard, or any other form of interaction that p5 supports.  (there's lots!).

Spend some time and play with the examples available for you in P5. Customize you chart some way.  This is an opportunity to explore—your grade is not based on how impressive your animation is, so feel free to try things.  If you're comfortable with Javascript, try using external images or dynamic animations; if you're just learning about these things, try changing some values, adding code from the examples, or jst playing around.

### Helpful Hints:

* Javascript tends to be very picky about there being paired `{}`  and `[]`.  If you've got a problem, check if that's it.
* Commas.  You need a comma after every item—it's OK if there' a comma after the last one, so just put them everywhere.
* Quotation marks.  If you've got a word somewhere, it should be in quotes.  Numbers don't need quotation marks, nor do keys.
* Whitespace.  Javascript tends to ignore whitespace, so don't worry to much about it.  Indentation is good, though, because it helps you keep track of what you're doing.
