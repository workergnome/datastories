    Assignment: **Draw one design for your final visualization.**  
    Due: **Monday, May 1st, 1:30pm Eastern**
---

You will take your chosen dataset and, guided by your brief and sketches, provide one visual design for your work.   This is not intended to be the final data visualization—it's to figure out how you would like this to look.  Final text and data will be added later.

The goal of this is to discover what visuals are most appropriate for your visualization and to discover what voice and is most appropriate for the structure.  It's also to determine final layout and typography.

The final form should be a one-page image.  At this point, you should decide what software is most appropriate for your final visualization—you can use any software or collection of software, or even hand-drawing.  (I warn you, though, if you do it by hand you will be compared to people using software, so unless you're a very good artist I don't recommend it).


This design should include:

* Basic Layout
* A clear visual hierarchy
* Typographic choices (Fonts, sizes, weights)
* Color Palette
* Text Areas
* Graphic Areas
* Credit/Datasource/other placeholder text

Please include a brief description of your thought process as part of this.

When complete, please email your **design** (as a JPG or PDF) to <david.newbury@gmail.com> and <lauren.renaud@gmail.com> 

**This assignment is due Monday, May 1st, before class.**
