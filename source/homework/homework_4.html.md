    Assignment: **Create a Dashboard about dog licensing in Allegheny County using Tableau Public.**  
    Due: **Monday, April 17th, 1:30pm Eastern**
---

You are to create a new dashboard using the dog licensing data we worked with in the Tableau Workshop.

To present this data, we'll be using [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com).  You can **create** a public account on their website and publish your workbook there.

You must create a different dashboard with the same dog dataset that we worked with in class.  You can choose to integrate other data sources you find, or you can use the existing data sources that we've worked with in this workshop—there's lots of clever data in them.  Your choice!

Your dashboard should contain at least one geographical visualization and one non-geographical visualization.  You must provide enough text within the dashboard that I can figure out what you were trying to do—helpful titles, captions, labels, and axis will make that easier.

You **cannot** just use the existing dashboard and re-color it.  Both the geographical visualization and the chart have to use at least some different data columns, different calculations, or different chart types. 


When complete, please email a link to your **public** tableau workbook to <david.newbury@gmail.com> and <lauren.renaud@gmail.com> 

**This assignment is due Monday, April 17th, before class.  Please don't modify your workbook after submitting it.**
