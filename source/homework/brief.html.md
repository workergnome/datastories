    Assignment: **Write a design brief for your final visualization.**  
    Due: **Monday, April 17th, 1:30pm Eastern**
---

You will select one of the datasets provided in class, and will create a 1-2 page written brief laying out the project plan for that visualization.  This brief should describe:

* The Conditions
* The Audience
* The Stakeholders
* The Concept
* The Output Format
* The Final Setting
* The Big Idea
* External Requirements

Some of these constraints are real, and will come from the requirements of the homework, but others are fictional, and will need to be created by you.  Think about to whom you would want to present this.

The end goal of this project is to create a portfolio piece that demonstrates your ability to think creatively, so it will be helpful to think about to whom you'd like to present this work, and design it for that sort of audience.  If you'd like to end up in the non-profit space, think about that as a potential audience.  If you'd like to end up in business, think about that audience.

The final deliverable will be a 1-2 page proposal that provides context and vision for your work, and lays out your creative thinking.  From reading this brief, I should be able to imagine what your final project might look like.

Appendices with supplementary reference material are allowed, and do not count towards your 2 page limit.

When complete, please email a link to your **brief** as a PDF to <david.newbury@gmail.com> and <lauren.renaud@gmail.com> 

**This assignment is due Monday, April 17th, before class.**
